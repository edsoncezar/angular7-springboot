Angular 7 + Spring Boot 2 + Spring Data JPA + MySQL

Basically, I created two projects:

springboot2-jpa-crud: This project is a simple Customer Credit System using Spring Boot 2, JPA and MySQL as a database and RESTFul APIs.

angular7-springboot-client: A single application using Angular 7 as front-end technology. This Angular 7 application consumes a Restful APIs served by a springboot2-jpa-crud project.

First I needed a mysql database:

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/

After I needed to create a schema:

users_database

There are many ways to create a Spring Boot application. The simplest way is to use Spring Initializrat http://start.spring.io/, which is an online Spring Boot application generator.

I used part of this tutorial as reference:
